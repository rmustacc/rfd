.Sh PARAMETERS

A pointer to the mac interrupt's private data that was passed in via the
.Vt mi_handle
member of the
.Xr mac_intr 9S
structure.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mi_enable
and
.Fn mi_disable
entry points are used by the MAC framework when it wishes to disable the
generation of interrupts for the ring and poll on the it through the
.Xr mri_poll 9E
entry point.
.Pp
These entry points should enable and disable the generation of the
interrupt for the ring that is represented
.Fa driver .
Generally,
.Fa driver
is part of a receive ring's
.Fa mri_intr
member in the
.Xr mac_ring_info 9S
structure and refers to a specific ring.
Importantly, this entry point is not asking to enable and disable the
interrupt for all consumers of it.
This should be implemented through device specific means such as writing
to registers or sending control messages to enable or disable the
generation of interrupts for the specified ring.
.Pp
Drivers must not implement this in terms of the DDI interrupt functions
such as
.Xr ddi_intr_enable 9F
and
.Xr ddi_intr_disable 9F .
.Pp
When manipulating the device's control of interrupts, the driver should
be careful to serialize these changes with the ongoing processing of
interrupts through the interrupt handler and the
.Xr mri_poll 9E
entry point.
These should all be protected by the same mutex which is scoped to the
ring itself when the ability to turn on and off interrupt generation may
be manipulated on a per-ring basis.
Failure to properly synchronize this may lead to the driver mistakenly
delivering the same packet twice through both its interrupt handler and
its
.Xr mri_poll 9E
entry point.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn mi_enable
and
.Fn mi_disable
entry points should return
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise the appropriate error number should be returned.
